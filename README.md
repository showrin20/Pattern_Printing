# Pattern Printing

## Overview

The **Pattern Printing** project demonstrates how to generate various text-based patterns using loops in programming. This project can be used as a reference for learning and practicing control structures, particularly nested loops, to produce different shapes and patterns.

## Problem Solving Approach

To solve pattern printing problems, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Number of Lines**: Decide how many lines (rows) you want to print. This also determines how many times the outer loop will run.
2. **Determine the Number of Columns**: For each row, establish how many columns of output you want to print.
3. **Decide What to Print**: Choose the character or symbol you wish to print (e.g., `*`, numbers, etc.).
4. **Outer Loop**: Iterate over the rows. This outer loop handles the number of rows.
5. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, iterate over the columns. This inner loop handles the number of columns.
6. **Print Columns**: Print the desired character for each column in the inner loop.
7. **Print Rows**: After the inner loop completes for a row, move to the next line for the next row.
